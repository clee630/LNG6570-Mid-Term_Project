# LNG6570-Mid-Term Project
In this assignment, you will design and carry out an experiment to determine whether the imagineability of a word influences the recognition time of an image. Participants will be asked to participate in a visual recognition task where they hear a word (either high imaginable or low imaginable) and then see a visual representation of that word or an unrelated image.
